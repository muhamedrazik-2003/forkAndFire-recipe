            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span>Beat the eggs:</span>
                    In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
                    tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Heat the pan:</span>
                    Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Cook the omelette:</span>
                    Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
                    coat the surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Add fillings (optional):</span>
                    When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
                    chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Fold and serve:</span>
                    As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
                    over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Enjoy:</span>
                    Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
