      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Odin's Recipe began as a simple assignment from The Odin Project. The goal was to create a website with a
        homepage that showcases a few recipes and allows users to navigate to individual recipe pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first version, built in <strong>August 2024</strong>, featured a basic layout â€” mostly plain text and images
        with minimal styling and structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast forward 10 months to <strong>June 2025</strong>, the entire site has been redesigned with a modern, clean
        layout, improved typography, better spacing, and subtle animations to enhance the user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        One major update is the introduction of a single dynamic recipe page. Instead of having a separate HTML file for
        each recipe, the site now uses JavaScript to inject recipe data into a single <code>recipe.html</code> page.
        When a user clicks on a recipe card, the corresponding recipe ID is passed through the URL, and the page loads
        the correct content dynamically.
      </p>

      <div class="before-after">
        <figure>
          <img src="./images/about/old-homepage-image.png" alt="Old Home Page" />
          <figcaption>Original Homepage</figcaption>
        </figure>

        This project reflects my growth as a frontend developer â€” evolving from writing raw HTML layouts to building
        dynamic, responsive UIs with clean structure and user-focused design.
