      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        Odin's Recipe began as a simple assignment from the Odin Project. The goal was to build a website with a homepage
        that displays a few recipes and allows users to navigate to individual recipe pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first version, created on <strong>August 2024</strong>, was a basic layout — mostly plain text and images
        without much styling or structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward 10 months to <strong>June 2025</strong>, I've completely redesigned the site with a modern, clean
        layout, improved typography, spacing, and subtle animations to enhance the user experience.
      </p>
      <p>Currently i have only redesigned the website </p>

      <div class="before-after">

          <figcaption>Original Homepage</figcaption>
        </figure>

        This project reflects my growth as a frontend developer — from building with raw HTML and basic structure to creating
        responsive layouts, designing clean UIs, and thinking like a user.
